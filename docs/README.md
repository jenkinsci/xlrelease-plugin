The XL Release Plugin allows Jenkins to create and optionally trigger
releases in XebiaLabs XL Release by adding one post-build action to your
Jenkins installation:

-   Release with XL Release

 

If instead you are looking to trigger Jenkins from XL Release, you want
to look at the XL Release Jenkins
task: <https://docs.xebialabs.com/release/how-to/create-a-jenkins-task>

# Requirements

-   XL Release 4.5.0 or later
-   Java 1.8 or later

For older versions of XL Release, use [Jenkins plugin version
4.0.11](http://updates.jenkins-ci.org/download/plugins/xlrelease-plugin/4.0.11/xlrelease-plugin.hpi).

# Features

-   Start the release process in XL Release
-   Load a release template from XL Release
-   Provide input for release variables
-   Use Jenkins credentials plugin

release notes, visit the [XebiaLabs documentation
site](https://docs.xebialabs.com/release/how-to/using-the-xl-release-plugin-for-jenkins.html#plugin-configuration-in-jenkins).
